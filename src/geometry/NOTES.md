# Notes for this Geometry folder

First of all, the main concept was copied [here](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcUTIL_Geometry2D/blob/main/olcUTIL_Geometry2D.h), made by the community of [OneLoneCoder](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder).

In this markdown, I will be writing down everything about the files here and my understanding of every class and function since I don't know much of anything about geometry.

This is for my future self, so feel free to navigate.
